# Panels and Dashboards


## Panels

A pannel is a where you can combine multiple reports into a single graph and table. You could corelate your financial data with the amount of code, programmers produce as well as bugs and world-wide social media mentions of your product. Reports in a panel are automatically merged by time period and date first, but you could choose to join two or more reports on identical group-by fields like country, city or user name.

## Dasboards

Dashboard allows you to place multiple reports or pannels onto a single page. With dashboards you could easily create a replica of Google Analytics or any other existing analytic systems.
