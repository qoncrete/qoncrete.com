## Real-time Analytics

Virtually all data that contains time can be considered time-series data. Multiple sources of data can be merged onto the same graph with the X axis labeled time and the Y axis a combination of multiple different values (counts, averages, dollars, etc). Qoncrete helps with this, allowing you to store, analyze  and predict petabytes of time-series data quickly at a much lower cost compared to anything currently available.
