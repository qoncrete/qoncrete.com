# Pricing, Payment and Limits

## Pricing
Pricing is calculated by the amount of data __stored on__ and __transfered from__ Qoncrete.  Storage costs for users is 0.8 RMB (~$0.1) per GB per month for raw event data and reports. Querying or exporting data is 0.4 RMB (~$0.05) per GB per month.

## Payment
Qoncrete is a point based system. Points are pre-purchased per account, and deducted at the end of each day based on usage (storage is averaged and API bandwidth is summed).

## Limits
Currently there are no limitations. You can send, process and retrive as much data as you want.
