# Our Story

Qoncrete was first developed as an internal solution to a problem at a fast growing startup. Too much time was being diverted handeling the collection, processing, analysis, and presentation of data.  There were systems producing billions of events (terabytes of data) every day, and different parties all wanted access in different kinds of ways.  Developers wanted to monitor system performance, managers wanted to make reports of profit margins, sales wanted the latest numbers on user behavior to show off to clients. 

Qoncrete was built to make everyone's life in the company easier, encourage a data-driven approach to decision making, and streamline previously time consuming tasks.  What was first a prototype in the tech department grew over the course of 2 years into a mature product that was being used all throughout the 200 person company.

The more time our team spent in the world of data, the more we understood a solution like ours was needed by many others. Our APIs allow for the creation of products with programatic, data-driven decision making; our interfaces allows non-tech people to discover and correlate different sets of data; and our unique back end design allows our product to be hundreds of times cheaper than any other solution while providing more functionality.

In a world dominated by software, data is king. Our mission is to "quantify, understand, correlate, and predict the world's data". We want to make the world a better place, a data driven place, where information and not hunches influence and create actionable insights.
